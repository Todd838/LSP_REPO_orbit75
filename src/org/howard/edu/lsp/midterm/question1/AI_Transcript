During the preparation of my answer for Question 1, I consulted ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5) to clarify concepts related to class cohesion, the use of Arthur Riel heuristics, and strategies for refactoring low-cohesion classes. 

Source: ChatGPT
Date of consultation: October 20, 2025
Purpose: Guidance on analyzing the StudentPortalHelper class for cohesion and suggestions on possible refactoring approaches.

I used this guidance to ensure I understood the principles and to help organize my own reasoning. All analysis and conclusions in my submitted essay are my own work and were written in my own words.

No additional sources were used.
