During the preparation of my answer and implementation for Question 2, I consulted ChatGPT to clarify the proper use of method overloading, exception handling, and writing a clean Java API for the AreaCalculator class. 

Source: ChatGPT 
Date of consultation: October 20, 2025
Purpose: Guidance on implementing overloaded area methods, exception handling, and explaining conceptual reasoning about overloading.

I used this guidance to ensure I understood method overloading and exception handling concepts. All code and explanations in my submitted files are my own work and were written in my own words.

No additional sources were used.
