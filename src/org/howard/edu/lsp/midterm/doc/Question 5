Before and during this course, I used AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist me in understanding programming concepts, debugging errors, and improving my overall workflow. Early on, I mainly relied on AI for explanations of Java syntax and structure, which helped me build a stronger foundation in object-oriented programming. As the course progressed, I began using AI more strategically — for example, to brainstorm possible solutions, understand UML relationships, and review my logic before finalizing a design. This approach allowed me to learn actively rather than just copying solutions, and it made me more confident in independently solving coding problems.
The benefits of using AI were clear: it provided immediate feedback, simplified complex concepts, and helped me work through errors faster. However, I also recognized its limitations. Sometimes, AI-generated responses were too general or didn’t align perfectly with my specific assignment requirements, so I had to double-check the information and apply my own reasoning. Despite this, the learning experience was enhanced because I learned to verify and adapt AI output critically. Looking ahead, I believe AI will continue to shape how I learn and solve problems both academically and professionally. It can serve as a powerful research and problem-solving companion, but true understanding still comes from personal effort, experimentation, and reflection.
