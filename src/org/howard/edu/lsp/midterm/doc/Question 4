Device is defined as an abstract class because it provides common properties (id, location, heartbeat, etc.) and partial functionality shared by all devices, but it does not represent a specific device type on its own. The Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces define behaviors that can be selectively added to concrete classes, allowing flexibility with some devices (like Thermostat) that are networked but not battery-powered, while others (like Camera) have both.
This design demonstrates interface-based multiple inheritance, not class-based multiple inheritanceâ€”Java allows a class to extend only one superclass but implement multiple interfaces, achieving the effect of multiple inheritance through behavior composition.
